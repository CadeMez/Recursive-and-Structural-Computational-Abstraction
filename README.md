<h1>JProj - Recursive and Structural Computational Abstraction</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project investigates integer arithmetic with arbitrarily large values through the implementation of long addition and long multiplication algorithms. The assignment required students to represent integer values as lists of digits stored in reverse order, enabling digit-wise computation. Core functionality included the conversion between strings and digit lists, safe digit retrieval, long addition with carries, multiplication by a single digit, and full multiplication of two multi-digit integers. The algorithms were developed incrementally to highlight decomposition into smaller subproblems and to reinforce fundamental string and list manipulations in Java. Testing included both provided JUnit cases and student-designed examples to ensure correctness. The project emphasized precision in representing values beyond primitive integer limits, the role of data structures in algorithmic problem solving, and the connection between classical arithmetic algorithms and modern computational applications.
